# map.in-file-for-LAMMPS-Phonon-Dispersion
This repository contains the code to generate the map.in file essential for computing the phonon dispersion relation using the fix phonon command in LAMMPS. The map.in file maps atom IDs to lattice indices for any supercell, enabling accurate phonon calculations in molecular dynamics simulations.
